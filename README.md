# Fullstack React Router + Cloudflare Workers Examples

This repository contains example projects demonstrating how to build fullstack applications using React Router v7 and Cloudflare Workers. These examples were created for a Remix meetup presentation on building modern web applications on the edge.

## Projects

This repository showcases a progressive journey through three different approaches to building with React Router and Cloudflare Workers, each building upon the previous one:

### 1. [SPA + Cloudflare](spa-plus-cf)

A basic Single Page Application (SPA) using React Router and Cloudflare Workers, demonstrating the fundamental integration between a React frontend and Workers backend. This version uses a basic setup with separate frontend and Worker development environments.

### 2. [SPA with Vite + Cloudflare](spa-cf-vite)

An enhanced SPA example introducing the Cloudflare Vite Plugin for a unified development experience. This version brings:

-   Seamless development and production deployment
-   Database integration with Drizzle ORM
-   Improved developer experience with unified build pipeline

### 3. [Guest Book](guest-book)

The final evolution showcasing a full-featured application with:

-   React Router's framework mode for SSR
-   Complete Cloudflare Workers integration
-   Advanced Vite plugin usage for SSR
-   Seamless development-to-production workflow

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate different approaches to building fullstack applications using React Router v7 and Cloudflare Workers. The projects progressively show:

-   Basic SPA deployment on Cloudflare Workers
-   Integration with Vite and the Cloudflare Vite Plugin
-   Advanced usage with React Router's framework mode
-   Worker bindings integration
-   Development to production workflow

Each project has its own README with specific details about implementation and setup.
